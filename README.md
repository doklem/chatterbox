# Chatterbox #

## Introduction ##

This is a sample .NET Core chat application, which uses a client-server architecture. Its clients are designed with
[Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf) and the server with
[ASP.NET Core Web Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/web-host). They communicate through web sockets by using
[ASP.NET Core SingalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction).
